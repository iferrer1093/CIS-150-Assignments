Welcome to the Employee Management Program. 

To run this program open it in Visual Studio 2022 with the .net desktop development for C# or any other C# compatible IDE with the .net SDK. Run the .sln file named "Employee Management Project.sln" or open the "Employee Management Project" Folder inside of Visual Studio 2022 or whatever C# compatible IDE it is that you are using.
There are 3 types of employees available. 
1. Full Time Employees. The pay for these employees is calculated by the base salary times their bonus. 
2. Part Time Employees. The pay for these employees is calculated by multiplying their hourly rate by hours worked.
3. Contractors. The pay for these employees is calculated by how much their contract is paying them instead of by hours and an hourly rate.
